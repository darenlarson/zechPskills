            <h1>Prisoner Skill</h1>
            <p> We believe there are alot of prisoners out there who deserve second chances.
                Unfortunately, there is a huge societal stigma that has been cast onto all prisoners,
                making second chances seem impossible. We are here to break that stigma and to
                create mutually beneficial second chances along the way. <br><a href = https://lambda-prisoner-skills.herokuapp.com/admin/ target = "_blank"><button><span>Get Started <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></span></button></a></p>

                    <h2>Why We Care</h2>
                    <p>There are an estimated 5 million formerly incarcerated people living in the U.S., and approximately 27% of those people are unemployed. That's nearly 5X the unemployment rate of the general United States population.</p>

                <section class = "box two">
                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>We seek to help forward-thinking inmates who are motivated to
                        better and prepare themselves for their post-prison futures. The unemployment rate is tragically
                        high for former inmates, so our goal is to give them a leg up.
                        At the same time we give them the opportunity to develop and improve their skills
                        while making some money along the way.</p>

                    <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
                    <p>In a study by Johns Hopkins Hospitals, employees with a criminal background had a lower turnover rate than those with no criminal background.</p>

                    <h2>What Next</h2>
                    <p>The majority of people incarcerated in federal prisons are convicted of non-violent crimes. Almost 11,000 youth are imprisoned for offenses that aren't even crimes. Prisoners in the U.S. get a bad rap, but studies show they are willing to work, and they work hard.</p>
